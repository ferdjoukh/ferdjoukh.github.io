<img src="img/software.png" alt="News" class="full-img"/>

We are proud to announce that our model generation tool has a new release, grimm 3.0 !

You can download this new version [here](https://github.com/ferdjoukh/grimm/releases/tag/v3.0-d9112018). 

## New features and corrected bugs

- Adding an Exception when a given rootClass is incorrect.
- Correcting some issues (related to tricky meta-models as ecore.ecore): linking EObjects in a hierarchy of inheritance, checking the superType of an EObject instead of just comparing class names before linking.
- Adding more diversity while connecting EObjects. Currently, diverse EObjects are chosen randomly.
- Corrected problem of attributes typing (== replaced by equals).

## Documentation
