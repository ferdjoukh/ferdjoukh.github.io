<ul>
<li>Adding an Exception when a given rootClass is incorrect.</li>
<li>Correcting some issues (related to tricky meta-models as ecore.ecore): linking EObjects in a hierarchy of inheritance, checking the superType of an EObject instead of just comparing class names before linking.</li>
<li>Adding more diversity while connecting EObjects. Currently, diverse EObjects are chosen randomly.</li>
<li>Corrected problem of attributes typing (== replaced by equals).</li>
</ul>
