<p><img src="img/software.png" alt="News" class="full-img"/></p>
<p>We are proud to announce that our model generation tool has a new release, grimm v4.0 !</p>
<p>You can download this new version <a href="https://github.com/ferdjoukh/grimm/releases/tag/v4.0-d15112018">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="new-features">New features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add specific processing for containment references. Now it is different from classic references and not included in the produced CSP instances.</li>
<li>Add support for deep containment references (&gt;1). Now you can have containment references between two classes (not only root class).</li>
<li>Add support for boolean, integer, string and enum attributes. Moreover, randomness is added while instantiating attributes.</li>
<li>Diversity is added in treating EOpposite references. Now the created GCC has diverse upper bound. This makes the generated models different even when the same configuration is used.</li>
<li>Adding the possibility of generating 0 instances for a given class (you can do that by using a config file).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="corrected-bugs">Corrected bugs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Corrected bugs in ConfigrationFileReader class. Now the order of classes in a config file is not important.</li>
<li>Corrected bug: unchangeable references and attributes are not considered any more.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using grimm is easy ! 5 minutes to read the <a href="https://github.com/ferdjoukh/grimm/blob/master/README.md">documentation</a> and then go !</p>
